/*
    The reputation systems in Neverwinter Nights are known to be a rather
    messy black box. Scripts can cause creatures to change to standard
    factions but not custom ones very easily, and "reputation changes" are
    done engine-wide not controlled by scripts.

    This has some utility functions to take the edge off the issues especially
    around making a hostile creature friendly (it is recommended to make
    these kinds of creatures immortal if they must do some kind of
    speaking).
